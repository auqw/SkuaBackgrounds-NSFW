[Download this repo](https://github.com/auqw/SkuaBackground-NSFW/archive/refs/heads/main.zip) OR choose an SWF file in the repository and put it in `~/Documents/Skua/Themes`
# Rules:
1. NO **POLITICS** This is a video game, we don't care about your political views
2. Naming Convention: 
 - Not Accepted: `73ufhehxw.swf` > Accepted: `ProperName.swf` E.G., If your PR says `ChaosQueenBeleen.swf` but the file is named `ghasdh123.swf`, we will make you change it before merging

# Making a Background
If you want to make a background, the **image needs to follow** the `16:9` aspect ratio

For editing the [Baseplate.swf](./BASEPLATE.swf) with your own image, you need to use [JPEXS Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler)
 - Scroll to the `How to install` section on their Gitgub page for installing instructions.
1. Download [Baseplate.swf](./BASEPLATE.swf)
2. Right-click [Baseplate.swf](./BASEPLATE.swf) and open with [JPEXS Flash Decompiler](https://github.com/jindrapetrik/jpexs-decompiler)
3. Click on Shapes and click the only DefineShape
4. Click Replace and choose your `16:9` image
5. (Optional) Click on `images` and delete the original image that was in the SWF to save space
6. Click Save
7. (Optional) Make a pull request here to share it

If you want a plain colored background, make an image 4x4 in pixels and put the color you want, then do the steps above. It **does not** have to follow the 16:9 aspect ratio
